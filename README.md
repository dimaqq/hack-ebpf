# hack-ebpf
My journey into eBPF, practical steps, discovering limitations, performance benchmarks...

Kernel source code and environment:

* bpf-next repo, currently at 2e29df8dbb0c
* kernel `.config`, based of arch linux cloud image, aarm64, adapted to linux 6.5.0+
* tooling UTM for macos, arch linux preset
